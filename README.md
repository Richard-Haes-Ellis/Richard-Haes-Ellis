- 👋 Hi, I’m @Richard-Haes-Ellis
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to Robotics and Control. I've done quite a few robot with ROS and some with ROS2, nothing too advanced but enough to get going. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about electronics design and fast predictive control for non linear unstable systems. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that align to what I'm learing or interested in. 
- 📫 You can reach me through my email at richard9661h@gmail.com
